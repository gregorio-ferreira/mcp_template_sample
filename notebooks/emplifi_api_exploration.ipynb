While the home kit was a nod to the Bayer Cross, an iconic symbol of the city‚Äôs ties to science and medicine, the away nods to another landmark of Leverkusen, the Japanese Garden.\n\nLike most Bayer away kits, the jersey arrives with white, but the real talking point is the pink gradient on the upper torso. Embellished with a series of floral graphics, its inclusion comes as a reference to the garden‚Äôs cherry blossoms ‚Äî a striking sight during the spring.\n\nThe look stretches from shoulder to shoulder and makes its way down the chest before fading into white. To contrast, both the club crest and New Balance logo are dipped in red, a design choice shared with the home kit, with the same shade paired with white to form a two-tone crewneck collar.\n\nThe jersey is powered by New Balance‚Äôs latest performance technology, with the Elite version sporting a close-fitting cut. Players and fans can keep cool and comfortable in the heat thanks to breathable mesh fabric, with a commitment to sustainability shown through the use of recycled polyester.\n\nThe New Balance and Bayer Leverkusen 2025/26 away kit is available now online and via select retailers.",

         "Fight back against the pesticide immunity bill! CLICK NOW:  https://standforhealthfreedom.com/actions/section453/\nhttp://www.stoppoison.org\n\nThis is so wrong! Chemical industries are attempting to pass pesticide immunity legislation granting legal immunity to the producers of pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides. Find out what you can do to stop the pesticide immunity bill. Your health is on the line!\n\n0:00 Introduction: Legal immunity bill\n0:54 Failure-to-warn pesticide lawsuits \n1:45 Modern AG Alliance immunity \n2:35 Is glyphosate a carcinogen?\n3:19 Kelly Ryerson interview\n6:10 Can herbicide lawsuit protections be reversed?\n7:42 EPA-approved label immunity \n9:24 How to stop pesticide immunity bills\n\nDATA: \nhttps://glyphosatefacts.com/the-pesticide-immunity-shield/\nhttps://drbrg.co/4fsUtxh \n\nThis new chemical immunity bill pretends to support farmers while legally granting immunity from lawsuits against harm to the producers of pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides. There have been billions of dollars in settlements from glyphosate, and there are currently 165,000 active cancer lawsuits against the producer. If this immunity bill passes, all of these lawsuits will go away!\n\nSection 453 of the bill grants legal immunity to domestic and foreign chemical producers. Future failure-to-warn pesticide lawsuits would be dismissed. \n\nWe often trust chemicals and drugs that are considered safe and effective, only to find out that they are actually deadly. This is due to a loophole allowing drug and chemical companies to keep negative safety studies confidential and unpublished. \n\nThe Modern Ag Alliance is a ‚Äúfront group‚Äù created by Bayer. They create grassroots movements to make it appear that most people agree that glyphosate is a critical farming tool. They claim that it's safe and vital to secure our food supply. \n\nGroups within the WHO have labeled glyphosate as a probable carcinogen for humans, and many people have won cancer lawsuits against the manufacturer. Despite the evidence, chemical companies are taking a food security stance, claiming we will starve without glyphosate.\n\nKelly Ryerson explains that if these companies achieve legal immunity, they will be allowed to continue to use chemicals that have been shown to cause health problems like Parkinson‚Äôs, cancer, ALS, infertility, and more, with no consequences! This agricultural chemical liability shield will be virtually impossible to reverse if passed.\n\nTo fight back against the pesticide legal immunity bill, contact your state senators and tell them you do not support any language granting legal immunity to chemical companies!\n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 60, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

         "I recently met a family that runs HP Singh Fabrics in Delhi‚Äîdeeply rooted in India‚Äôs textile legacy. From Andhra's Kalamkari and Ikkat to Gujarat‚Äôs Ajrak, Rajasthan‚Äôs Bagru, Bengal‚Äôs Jamdani, and the once world-renowned Indian Chintz‚Äîevery 100 km in India reveals a new textile tradition, a new art form, and a new story. But behind the beauty lies a deeper challenge.\n\nToday, majority of India‚Äôs cotton is genetically modified BT cotton‚Äîcontrolled by foreign corporations like Monsanto. Our indigenous varieties are disappearing, our water usage is unsustainable, and our farmers remain underpaid. Despite being one of the largest cotton producers, India lags nearly 10 times behind China in textile exports.\n\nThe HP Singh family emphasized that India can reclaim its position as a global textile powerhouse‚Äîbut only if we invest in indigenous cotton, build integrated textile zones, and create India-led global certification systems. Unlike countries like China and Bangladesh that thrive on vertical integration, India‚Äôs supply chains remain scattered and inefficient, driving up costs and pushing out the very farmers and weavers who built this industry.\n\nThis conversation isn‚Äôt just about fabric‚Äîit‚Äôs about respect, sustainability, and economic self-reliance. With the right infrastructure and dignity for every hand in the value chain, India can‚Äîand must‚Äîlead the global textile market once again.\n\n#rahulgandhi, #‡§∞‡§æ‡§π‡•Å‡§≤_‡§ó‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ß‡•Ä, #textiles, #textilemarket  \n\n_\n\n‚Ä¢ WhatsApp: https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va4UV6wEgGfQZv5KY12z   \n‚Ä¢ YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/rahulgandhi \n‚Ä¢ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rahulgandhi \n‚Ä¢ Twitter: https://twitter.com/rahulgandhi \n‚Ä¢ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/rahulgandhi\n\n_\n\n‚ìí Copyright and ownership of this audio-visual content belongs to Rahul Gandhi.\n \nAttribution ‚Äî You must give full credit for use of this audio-visual content in the format specified hereinafter: ‚ÄúSource: Rahul Gandhi's YouTube Channel, @rahulgandhi‚Äù.

And yet, it‚Äôs still sprayed on crops all over the U.S.\\n\\nHere‚Äôs the good news:\\nYou can reduce your exposure dramatically by following the EWG‚Äôs Dirty Dozen and Clean 15 lists.\\n\\nüß™ Dirty Dozen = the fruits and veggies with the highest pesticide residues. Always try to buy these organic if you can afford it. Note: these are still better than any ultra processed food.\\nü•ë Clean 15 = produce with natural protection (like a peel or husk), and generally safe to buy conventional.\\n\\nGeneral rule: If it has a thick peel‚Äîlike an avocado or banana‚Äîit‚Äôs likely safer. If you eat the whole thing‚Äîlike spinach or strawberries‚Äîgo organic.\\n\\nSave this for your next grocery trip.
